## Overview

This project is a personal inventory management for DMC threads (with the ability to expand to other crafting supplies)

It will allow individual logins. Each user will be able to update their personal inventory of threads based on DMC codes. They will also be able to add threads that they require (a boolean?) and generate a shopping list.

They will also have projects (a separate class/table?) which will have a list of threads being used. If the thread is already in inventory it will mark the amount as potentially incorrect. If the thread isn't in inventory it will push it to a shopping list (required)

Closing a project will prompt the user to update the relevant threads in their personal inventory
